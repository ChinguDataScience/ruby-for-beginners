# Programming is creation

*Things coming to live*

Programming is creation. Whenever you run a program a little universe is
created, things come to live and interact with each other, according to the
rules that you, as their creator, defined.

Imagine you build an application like Twitter. Then you, as a developer, would
say things like "There be users! And there be tweets!", in the programming
language of your choice, and once your application starts these things will
come into existence. Next you would go ahead and define "Users can create
tweets, and they can follow each other". And from now on, every time new users
are created in the little universe that is your application, these users will
have the ability to tweet and follow each other.
