# Working with Numbers

* In `irb`, calculate how many seconds have passed since the beginning of the
  year.


Note: At the moment, the following exercises require reading up until the
chapter "Object Methods":

* Look through the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/Fixnum.html">documentation for integer</a>
  numbers (called `Fixnum`) and find the methods that tell if a number is odd
  or even.
* In `irb`, use these methods to find out if certain numbers are odd or even.
  Numbers like `0, 1, 2, 99, -502` etc.
