# Built-in classes

Ruby comes with lots of things already baked in, and provides you with tons
of tools to use and hit the road running.

We will only look at some of the (by far) most widely used types of "things",
that is, classes, and look at some of the ways they can be used. These are:

* Numbers
* Strings
* Arrays
* Hashes
* Symbols
* True, False, and Nil

Before we discuss Arrays and Hashes we'll have a quick look at how to use
variables to give names to objects ... because that concept will be useful
for explaining these more powerful kinds of objects.

We will then also introduce the somewhat strange beasts that are Symbols
in Ruby, and close this introduction by briefly talking about `true`, `false`,
and `nil` (nothing).

These kinds of objects (types) probably make up for more than 95% of all native
(aka "built-in") objects that you'll be using on a day to day basis.

We will then, later, explain how you can define your own, more complicated, and
more interesting "things", e.g. a user, an email, a mailbox, and so on.
