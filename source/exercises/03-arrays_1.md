# Working with arrays (1)

Fill in the following line

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# ...
p numbers
```

So that you get the following output:

```ruby
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Now change your code so that you get the following output:

```ruby
[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
```

Now change your code so that you get the following output:

```ruby
[10, 8, 4, 2]
```
