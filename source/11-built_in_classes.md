# Built-in classes

Ruby comes with lots of things already baked in, and provides you with tons
of tools to use, and hit the road running.

We will only look at some of the most widely used types of "things", that is,
classes, and look at some of the ways they can be used. These are:

* Numbers
* Strings
* Symbols
* Arrays
* Hashes

A little later we will then also talk about 3 more types, which are: true,
false, and nil (nothing).
