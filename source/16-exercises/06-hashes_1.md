# Working with hashes (1)

Before you get started, make sure you have your text editor and terminal open,
and you have navigated to your exercises directory in the terminal. E.g. `cd
~/ruby-for-beginners/exercises`.

## Exercise 6.1

Make a new file `06-hashes_1-1.rb`, and fill in the following line:

```ruby
dictionary = { :one => 'uno', :two => 'dos', :three => 'tres' }
# your code goes here
```

So that it prints out `duo` (lowercase).

## Exercise 6.2

Copy that file to a new file `cp 06-hashes_1-1.rb 06-hashes_1-2.rb`, and change your
code so that it prints out the following. Do not use puts more than once.

```
Uno
Dos
Tres
```

## Exercise 6.3

Copy that file to a new file `cp 06-hashes_1-2.rb 06-hashes_1-3.rb`, and change your
code so that it prints out the following. Again, do not use puts more than
once.

```
Uno
Tres
```
