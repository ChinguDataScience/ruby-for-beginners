# Working with Numbers

In order to start `irb` simply open your terminal and type `irb`, then hit the
`return` key (`enter`). In order to quit `irb` again (and get back to your system
shell prompt) you can type `exit` or press `ctrl-d`, which does the same.


## Exercise 1.1

In `irb`, calcluate:

* How many hours are in a year.
* How many minutes are in a decade?
* How many seconds old are you?

## Exercise 1.2

What do you think happens when you combine the following floats and integers?

Try computing these in `irb`:

* `3.0 / 2`
* `3 / 2.0`
* `4 ** 2.0`
* `4.1 % 2`

Is the answer a float or an integer?

Note: At the moment, the following exercises require reading up until the
chapter "Object Methods":

* Look through the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/Fixnum.html">documentation for integer</a>
  numbers (called `Fixnum`) and find the methods that tell if a number is odd
  or even.
* In `irb`, use these methods to find out if certain numbers are odd or even.
  Numbers like `0, 1, 2, 99, -502` etc.

Credits: The exercises 1.1 and 1.2 are taken from [Introduction to
Ruby](http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/Tutorial/part_01/first_steps.html).
