# Working with nested arrays

Note: At the moment these exercises require reading up until "Block return values".
You should know how to use the method `collect` on arrays.

Before you get started, make sure you have your text editor and terminal open, and
you have navigated to your exercises directory in the terminal. E.g. `cd
~/ruby-for-beginners/exercises`.

## Exercise 5.1

Make a new file `5_1-arrays.rb`, and fill in the following line:

```ruby
numbers = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
# ...
p sums
```

So that you get the following output:

```ruby
[6, 15, 24]
```

## Exercise 5.2

Make a new file `5_2-arrays.rb`, and fill in the following line:

Fill in the following line

```ruby
numbers = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [2, 2, 2],
  [3, 2, 1]
]
# ...
lines.each { |line| puts line }
```

So that you get the following output:

```
