# Numbers

Numbers are simply numbers. You create one by writing it: `12.34` is Ruby code
and it represents the number twelve-point-three-four.

Under the hood, for reasons that are mostly technical, there are actually
different kinds of numbers. For example there are integer numbers (those
without a comma and decimal places), and depending on their size there are two
kinds of them. For floating point numbers there are even more. Unless you are
super curious, you can perfectly ignore all of that for now, and just think of
numbers as numbers.
