# Everything is an object

In Ruby everything is an object: Numbers are objects, strings, arrays and
hashes are objects. Even classes are objects.

Well, although Rubyist like saying this, it isn't actually completely true:
not *everything* is an object, but almost everything, and that's good enough to
know for now.
