# Objects, Classes, Methods

We've talked about objects quite a bit now, and you've learned to do things with
simple objects such as numbers and Strings.

You may have heard the following. Rubyist love saying it:

<p class="hint">
In Ruby everything is an object.
</p>

And actually, this is a little bit of a lie. Even though it's said often, it
isn't completely true: not *everything* is an object. There are a few things
that are not objects.

But almost everything is, and that's good enough to know for now.

In Ruby almost everything is an object :)

So, let's have a closer look at objects, and how they relate to classes and
methods in the next few chapters.

(Just in case you want to out-smart people at your local Ruby user group
though, remember to ask *"Really? Is an `if` statement an object in Ruby, too?"*)
