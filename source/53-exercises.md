# Exercises

Before you get started with the exercises make sure you have your text editor and
terminal open. In your terminal:

* Create a new directory where you want to keep Ruby files for our exercises. For
  example: `~/ruby-for-beginners/exercises`. In
  order to create that directory in the terminal you can run: `mkdir
  ~/ruby-for-beginners/exercises`.

* Then navigate to this directory: `cd ~/ruby-for-beginners/exercises`

* In order to check if you are in the right directory you can always run:
  `pwd`. (That's short for *print working directory*, meaning, it prints the name
  of the current directory.)

* In order to see all the files and subdirectories contained in the current
  directory you can run `ls`.

TODO: check these instructions for Windows.
