# Built-In Classes

As mentioned before, Ruby comes with lots of things already baked in, and
provides you with tons of tools to use and hit the road running.

We will have a quick look at the following ones for starters:

* Numbers
* Strings (texts)
* True, False, and Nil

Numbers and Strings (which is just a strange name for "texts") are some of the
most basic "things" that you deal with in Ruby on a regular basis. The are also
just enough lego bricks for us to dive into more interesting topics, such as
how objects, classes, and methods relate to each other, and how you can create
your own ones.

Before we do so we will also briefly mention the "things" `true`, `false`, and
`nil`, just because these are things that we'll come across along the way
anyway.

Later we will come back to this topic, and explain a few more built-in things,
which are:

* Arrays
* Hashes
* Symbols

Together these kinds of object types make up for more than 95% of all built-in
objects that you'll be using on a day to day basis.
