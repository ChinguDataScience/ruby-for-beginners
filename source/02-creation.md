# Programming is creation

*Things coming to life*

Programming is creation. Whenever you run a program a little universe is
created, things come to life and interact with each other, according to the
rules that you, as their creator, defined.

Imagine you build an application like Twitter. Then you, as a developer, would
say things like "Let there be users! And let there be tweets!", in the programming
language of your choice, and once your application starts these things will
come into existence. Next you would go ahead and define "Users can create
tweets, and they can follow each other". And from now on, every time new users
are created in the little universe that is your application, these users will
have the ability to tweet and follow each other.

TODO Talk about:

* Writing code is creative. Close to art, design, architecture, philosophy.
* Heidegger: "language is the house of being"
* all you need is a computer, internet connection and time
* Building fun applications, or useful little tools (Debbie's lunch roulette)


*I believe people want to express themselves when they program. They donâ€™t want
to fight with the language. Programming languages must feel natural to
programmers. I tried to make people enjoy programming and concentrate on the
fun and creative part of programming when they use Ruby.* - Yukihiro Matsumoto
