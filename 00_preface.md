I wanted to sit down and finally braindump some of the things that I kept
explaining to our beginner groups at Ruby Monsters, and take some notes on how
our curriculum currently works: building on our experiences with what worked
well, or not so well, in 4 different beginners groups that we have run over the
course of about 2.5 years.

I ended up writing down about 100,000 characters of text.

I'll put this on GitHub hoping that others might be interested to help improve
and complete it, so we can hopefully use this as a framework for future
beginners groups.

Keep in mind that, at this point, this text is merely a braindump. I have
simply kept writing, trying to roughly follow the same path of topics, in
the same order as we've introduced them on Mondays.

An incomplete list of what's definitely missing:

* Check and re-think the order of topics. Some are Ruby language basics, some are
  tips and advice about tooling, searching, and general reflections on
  programming. We used about the same order of language basics, but then just
  anecdotally threw in other topics. I'm not sure how to best structure this
  in a book-style online resource.

* Add exercises, or link to appropriate external exercises. At the least add
  the mailbox and formatter exercise.

* Add more topics that walk through the rest of the beginners curriculum, like
  using ERB to render a static HTML file, basics of HTTP, and building a
  Sinatra app that serves the same HTML.

* Add advice, tips, and recommendations for coaches.
