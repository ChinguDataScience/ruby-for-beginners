# Ruby For Beginners

*Ruby Monday Study Group curriculum for beginners*

This book has been written after we have run 4 beginners groups at our [Ruby
Monstas groups](https://github.com/rubymonsters) in Berlin. It outlines the
current state of our beginner groups curriculum.

You can [read it online here](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org) and
you can [find the source code here](https://github.com/rubymonsters/ruby-for-beginners).

This book is built using [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com).

The source code is kept on the master branch, which ignores the `build` directory.
The `build` directory is `.gitignored` and should be initialized with another git
repository so it can be pushed to the `gh-pages` branch in order to deploy
changes to the site.
