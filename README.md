# Ruby For Beginners

*Ruby Monday Study Group curriculum for beginners*

This book has been written after we have run 4 beginners groups at our [Ruby
Monstas groups](https://github.com/rubymonsters) in Berlin.

You can read it online at [Ruby For Beginners](http://rubymonsters.github.io/learning_ruby).

This book is built using [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com).

The source code is kept on the master branch, which ignores the `build` directory.
The `build` directory contains another git repository which should be pushed to
the `gh-pages` branch in order to deploy changes to the site.
