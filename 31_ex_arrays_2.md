# Exercise: Working with arrays (2)

Fill in the following line

```ruby
words = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"]
# ...
p words
```

So that you get the following output:

```ruby
["one", "three", "five"]
```

Now change your code so that you get the following output:

```ruby
["One", "Three", "Five"]
```

Now change your code so that you get the following output:

```ruby
["One <3", "Three <3", "Five <3"]
```

Now change your code so that you get the following output:

```ruby
["One <3", "Three <3<3<3", "Five <3<3<3<3<3"]
```

Now change your code so that you get the following output (hint: again, that's now a string, not an array):

```
One <3, Three <3<3<3, Five <3<3<3<3<3
```

Now change your code so that you get the following output, using the newline character `"\n"`:

```
One <3
Three <3<3<3
Five <3<3<3<3<3
```

Now change your code so that you get the following output:

```
One   <3
Three <3<3<3
Five  <3<3<3<3<3
```
