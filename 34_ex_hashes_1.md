# Exercise: Working with hashes (1)

Fill in the following line:

```ruby
dictionary = { :one => 'Uno', :two => 'Duo', :three => 'Tres' }
# ...
```

So that it prints out `duo` (lowercase).

Now change your code so that it prints out the following. Do not use puts more than once.

```
uno
duo
tres
```

Now change your code so that it prints out the following. Again, do not use puts more than once.


```
uno
tres
```
