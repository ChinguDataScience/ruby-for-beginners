# Exercise: Working with nested arrays

Fill in the following line

```ruby
numbers = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
# ...
p sums
```

So that you get the following output:

```ruby
[6, 15, 24]
```

Fill in the following line

```ruby
numbers = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [2, 2, 2],
  [3, 2, 1]
]
# ...
lines.each { |line| puts line }
```

So that you get the following output:

```
* ** ***
** ** **
*** ** *
```
