# Exercise: Storing our HTML to a file

In this exercise our goal is to store the generated HTML for our mailbox to a
file, so that we can finally view it in an actual browser.

Your objective is to write a file (using Ruby) that contains all the HTML
from the last exercise.

Building on the last exercise, keep all the code that you have, and change
the last line: instead of passing the HTML to `puts` you should be passing it
to a different method (which you will need to find), so that running your
program generates the file that we are after.

Opening that file in the browser should then render something like this:
