An incomplete list of what's missing:

* Check and re-think the order of topics. Some are Ruby language basics, some are
  tips and advice about tooling, searching, and general reflections on
  programming. We used about the same order of language basics, but then just
  anecdotally threw in other topics. I'm not sure how to best structure this
  in a book-style online resource.
* Add more exercises, link to additional external exercises.
* Add more topics that walk through the rest of the beginners curriculum, like
  writing to a file, using ERB to render a static HTML file, basics of HTTP,
  and building a Sinatra app that serves the same HTML.
* Add a chapter about Ruby (e.g. optimized for happiness)
* Add editor tips (shortcuts, syntax highlighting)
* Add most common exception messages

* Add advice, tips, and recommendations for coaches.

Notes:

* Fix arguments vs parameters
* Mention comments
* Mention omitting curly braces for hashes on method calls
* Bonus: calling methods is also referred as "sending messages", the method `send`
* Bonus: default arguments
* Bonus: splat operator for assignment and arguments

Preface: Explain how the curriculum works (major milestones). Explain in more
detail that everyone's supposed to go at their own pace, and not doing homework
is completely acceptable.

If local scopes are like rooms in a house, then instance variables are visible
in every room in the house.
