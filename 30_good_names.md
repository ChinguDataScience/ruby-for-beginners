# Using the right words

*Naming things is hard*

Similar to how obsessed programmers are about formatting they also care a lot
about how to name the things that they create.

Choosing good names for your variables, methods, and classes is important,
because this makes your code more expressive, and easy to read. In fact, once
you've learned the basic concepts of Ruby well crafted code will read almost
like a prosa text to you.  Not necessarily like your favorite novel, but maybe
like a recipe or other instructional prosa. Ruby is particularly great for
writing expressive, readable code.

TODO add a list of good and bad examples for class, method, and variable names

var1, var_2
variable, array, emails_list, emaillist
